## 🚀Get Started
To try ILLA, the most convenient way is to sign up and log in to [ILLA Cloud](https://cloud.illacloud.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=github-readme). 

You can also deploy and [self-host](https://docs.illacloud.com/self-hosted-deployment/) ILLA utils manually([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/)).


## ✨ Features

1. ⚽ **Real-time Collaboration:** We can create everything in real-time together.
2. 🤖 **Automate Support:** Connect everything and automate them in 5 seconds.
3. 🖥 **Self-hosted:** supports Docker & k8s
4. 📝 **Page Support:** The base of creating a content-rich and UI-friendly tool.
5. 🎨 **Powered by [ILLA Design](https://github.com/illacloud/illa-design):** Components should not constrain your imagination.

## Self-hosted
    
The ILLA CLI enables you to deploy ILLA Builder faster than your imagination. [Click here](https://docs.illacloud.com/self-hosted-deployment) for more details.
After successfully deployed, you can register with email address or log in with the following information:

## How to build your tool

#### 🎯 Step 1: Connect to your database

  </a>
</p>

#### 🎨 Step 2: Build UI with built-in components
Build your UI by dragging components to the canvas. We provide dozens of components including charts, tables, forms, and many more in Illa Builder and Illa Design. When components overlap, their position will be automatically adjusted, which makes the layout development easy and flexible.
